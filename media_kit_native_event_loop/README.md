Platform specific threaded event handling for media_kit. Enables support for higher number of concurrent instances.

A workaround for [dart-lang/sdk#51254](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/51254) & [dart-lang/sdk#51261](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/51261).

## Support

If you find [package:media_kit](https://github.com/media-kit/media-kit) package(s) useful or want to support future development, please consider supporting me. It's a very tedious process to write code, document, maintain & provide support for free. Since this is first of a kind project, it takes a lot of time to experiment & develop.
